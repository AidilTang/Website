      <h2>High Power Analytics in Big Data</h2>

      <h3>Analytics Levels:</h3>

        <li><strong>Diagnostic Analytics:</strong> Why it happens? - What-if Analysis, Root Cause Analysis, Query</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> What will happen? - Simulation, Regression Analysis, Casual Forecasting</li>
